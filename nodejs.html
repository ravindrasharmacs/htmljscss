        <h2>Event Loop Phases:</h2>
        <p>
            Timers: This phase executes callbacks scheduled by <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code>. If there are any timer callbacks that are due to execute, they will be processed here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I/O Callbacks: Executes I/O callbacks deferred from the previous cycle. These include almost all callbacks except for close callbacks, the ones scheduled by timers, and <code>setImmediate</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Idle, Prepare: Only used internally in Node.js for specific operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poll: This phase retrieves new I/O events and executes their callbacks. During this phase, the event loop processes events for an indefinite period until the polling queue becomes empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check: Executes callbacks scheduled by <code>setImmediate()</code>. These callbacks are executed immediately after the polling phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Close Callbacks: Executes close callbacks, such as <code>socket.on('close', ...)</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>How it Works:</h2>
        <p>
            When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the input script, and then starts executing the event loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asynchronous operations, such as I/O and timers, are scheduled in the corresponding phases of the event loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The event loop picks up these tasks in each cycle and processes them until there are no more tasks to handle.
